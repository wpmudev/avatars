## Avatars lets Multisite users upload, manage, and share profile and site avatars.

From ‘selfies’ to company logos, images help us personally connect with other users and companies on the web. This plugin integrates profile images in a way that feels native to WordPress core. Adding a simple avatars settings feature to the user profile, and a ‘Site Avatar’ option under ‘Settings’, brings a surprising new level of user participation.

 Included avatar settings give you control

### Better design. Big payoff.

Add profile pictures to [comments](http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/recent-global-comments-widget/), [friend](http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/friends/) lists, and [member](http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/members-directory/) and [site](http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/blogs-directory/) directories without having to configure a thing. WPMU DEV themes and directory plugins take full advantage of Avatars extensibility and offer complete plug-n-play integration.

### More flexibility and safer than Gravatar

Rather than sending your users to a third party site like Gravatar, and not being able to control the avatars they use, this plugin allows you to manage and control the avatars used on your site.

### Perfectly crop any image

Upload a picture, of any shape, and use the crop tool to make the perfect selection. Avatars are stored in their own unique folder, protecting your Media Library from getting filled with all the amazing profile images your users will be uploading.

### User AND site avatars

You want users to have great avatars for commenting and to go in their author profiles, but what about when you want to list your sites in a directory or feature them on the homepage of your network? Avatars takes care of that problem by allowing users to set both personal AND site avatars. Connect usernames with faces and site titles with company branding – add profile images to WordPress with Avatars.

## Usage

For help with installing plugins please refer to our [Plugin installation guide](https://wpmudev.com/docs/using-wordpress/installing-wordpress-plugins/). Once installed navigate to **Plugins** in the network admin dashboard and network activate the plugin. _Please note: This plugin isn't designed to be used with BuddyPress since it has its own inbuilt avatar system._

### Using with bbPress

*   Optionally you can network activate the **Avatars (BBPress)** plugin if you are using bbpress along with your WordPress install.
*   If you have an integrated bbPress install, you can install this optional plugin to allow custom avatars in your bbPress template. This plugin will only work if your bbPress install is integrated to use the WordPress user table.

### To Use:

With this plugin, your users can upload both a 'user avatar' and a 'blog avatar' which displays on any comments they leave across your network and in site and user listings on your network.
